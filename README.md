## Description

This is a full MERN Stack application using the CRUD principles and has utilised all the MERN technologies which include MONGO DB, EXPRESS, REACT, and NODE

This app is a basic social media app in which you can create a user, and the user can add comments or posts to a global window. This user can also add comments or delete comments on other user's post, and lastly this app can let a user like or dislike content.

We initially wanted to create an app that can be used from patients who have demantia, and their family members and friends can use an app to store all the important information

Hence there is a JWT Token used within this app that hashes passwords so that the information has authentication
